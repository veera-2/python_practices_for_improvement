# multiple assignment = it allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code

# name = "veera"
# age = 31
# attractive = True

name, age, attractive = "veera", 31, True  # this will print thesame thing as declearing the varibles seprately

print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

# veera = 30
# esha = 30
# teema = 30
# ramat = 30

veera = esha = teema = ramat = 30 # this is another way to asign int variables.

print(veera)
print(esha)
print(teema)
print(ramat)
